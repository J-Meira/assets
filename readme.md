This project dynamically generates a `content.json` file containing the list of files from a specific folder and a version number based on a tag or provided input. The script is written in TypeScript and integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions for automation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Folder Scanning**: Automatically lists all files in the specified directory.
- **Version Management**: Extracts the version from GitHub tags or command-line arguments.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and reliability.
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automates the generation and updates of `files.json`.
